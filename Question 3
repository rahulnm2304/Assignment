Suggestion
  1. View Photo Here & View Signature Here is not loaded and the imgage descrition could be mroe specific like View your photo here and view your signature here
  2.The help section in header should have some diffrent tab for Help and in that tab we should have option with links 
  3.Any HTML element you hover dont have any mouse over notes about the element e.g. if I am hovering my mouse on Name tag it should display tip "Enter name as per Aadhar card"
  4.Some text fileds like Name , MiddleName and lastName acception number as input it should be strcitly accept only String
  5.The Footer and the middle body have huge gap which needs to be fixed by UI team.
